## Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the Luisacuna Marketplace project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed:

* **PHP:** Version `8.3` or higher

* **Composer:** Latest version

* **Node.js & npm:** Latest LTS version (for compiling frontend assets)

* **Database:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite (configured in `.env`)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local system and navigate into the directory:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/luisacuna/marketplace.git](https://github.com/luisacuna/marketplace.git)
cd marketplace
```

Step 2: Configure Environment
Create your environment configuration file by copying the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, open the newly created .env file and update the database credentials (DB_* variables), application URL (APP_URL), and any third-party service keys (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, Crypto Platform API keys) as needed.

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install the backend (PHP) dependencies using Composer and the frontend (JavaScript/CSS) dependencies using npm:

```bash
# Install PHP dependencies
composer install

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install
```
### Step 4: Generate Application Key and Compile Assets
Generate a unique application key and link the public storage directory. Then, compile the Tailwind CSS (including Daisy UI and Flux) and Livewire assets:

```bash
# Generate application key
php artisan key:generate

# Link storage directory
php artisan storage:link

# Compile frontend assets
npm run build
```

### Step 5: Run Migrations and Seeding
Run the database migrations to create the necessary tables and use the seeders to populate the database with initial data (e.g., categories, initial admin user):

```bash
php artisan migrate --seed
```

### Step 6: Start the Local Server
Start the Laravel development server. The application will typically be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

```bash
php artisan serve
```
You should now be able to access and test the Luisacuna Marketplace locally!
